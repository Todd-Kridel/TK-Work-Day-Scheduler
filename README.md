# Bootcamp Module # Challenge Assignment -- a Something or Other

## Description

This current Module Challenge assignment -- an .... application -- provided a good mechanism for learning introductory JavaScript programming. A large portion and effort of my personal assignment was for a significant attempt to consider about and address concerns of data validation for various functions and processes; as well as varied usages of global-scope variables and local-scope variables. The assignment was also a good mechanism for examining and analyzing and understanding and then designing the external-file Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) -- design appearance -- code and HTML code of a webpage that had to be linked to the new JavaScript code. This assignment provided some additional attention to the concepts/objectives of "Accessibility" and "Responsiveness".
